# Async Transport 

[![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url]
[![Travis Build][travis-image]][travis-url]

AsyncTransport is a wrapper for the most excellent [await-to-js](https://github.com/scopsy/await-to-js) function. It provides support for 1 - n asynchronous functions, which may be executed in serial or parallel, and returns a predictable object for easy consumption.

## Pre-requisites
You need to use Node 7.6 (or later) or an ES7 transpiler to use async/await functionality. You can use babel or typescript for that.

## Install

```sh
npm i async-transport --save
```

or using yarn

```sh
yarn add async-transport
```

## Why use asyncTransport?
ES7 async/await allows us to write asynchronous code in a style that _looks_ synchronous. This is great, but under the hood, it is crucial to remember that we are still effectively dealing with [Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise). When implementing error handling inside Promises developers commonly use a try/catch approach like the following. 

```javascript
async function asyncTask(cb) {
  try {
    const user = await UserModel.findById(1);
    if(!user) return cb('No user found');
  } catch(e) {
    return cb('Unexpected error occurred');
  }

  try {
    const savedTask = await TaskModel({userId: user.id, name: 'Demo Task'});
  } catch(e) {
    return cb('Error occurred while saving task');
  }

  if(user.notificationsEnabled) {
    try {
      await NotificationService.sendNotification(user.id, 'Task Created');  
    } catch(e) {
      return cb('Error while sending notification');
    }
  }

  if(savedTask.assignedUser.id !== user.id) {
    try {
      await NotificationService.sendNotification(savedTask.assignedUser.id, 'Task was created for you');
    } catch(e) {
      return cb('Error while sending notification');
    }
  }

  cb(null, savedTask);
}
```

This becomes onerous, for example, when writing API endpoints that assemble data from multiple sources and may quickly become hard to read (and maintain). When researching ways to remedy this, I found [this Medium blog entry](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) written by Dima Grossman and began using the resulting [await-to-js](https://github.com/scopsy/await-to-js) package. This yielded code like so.

```javascript
import to from 'await-to-js';

async function asyncTask() {
  let err, user, savedTask;

  [err, user] = await to(UserModel.findById(1));
  if(!user) throw new CustomerError('No user found');

  [err, savedTask] = await to(TaskModel({userId: user.id, name: 'Demo Task'}));
  if(err) throw new CustomError('Error occurred while saving task');

  if(user.notificationsEnabled) {
    const [err] = await to(NotificationService.sendNotification(user.id, 'Task Created'));  
    if (err) console.error('Just log the error and continue flow');
  }
}
```

This was an improvement, but still did not fully meet my needs. In more complex use-cases, one still needed to manage and track multiple arrays as a result of wrapping async code in `to` method calls. 

What if we could utilize a single method to handle the execution of 1-n async functions, using `to` behind the scenes to keep things cleanly organized `asyncTransport` was my answer to this question.

Utilizing `asyncTransport`, the above code may be further simplified like so.

```javascript
import asyncTransport from 'async-transport';

async function asyncTask() {
  let result = await asyncTransport([ 
    UserModel.findById(1),
    TaskModel({userId: user.id, name: 'Demo Task'}),
    NotificationService.sendNotification(user.id, 'Task Created')
  ]);    

  // Print (or throw) errors by iterating over the errors collection
  if (result.hasErrors) {
    for (let i = 0; i < result.errors.length; i++) {
      if (result.errors[i]) { console.log(result.errors[i]); }
    }
  // Otherwise do stuff with the result data
  } else {
    console.log(result.data);
  }
}
```

Using this approach, we only have to track one variable, `result`, which will reliably contain three properties, `hasErrors`, `errors`, and `data`. 

`errors` and `data` are parallel arrays, both of which maintain the order of the functions provided. In other words, executing `asyncTransport([fn1, fn2, fn3])` will return an object whose `errors` contain `[errors-from-fn1, errors-from-fn2, errors-from-fn3]` as well as a `data` array that contains `[data-from-fn1, data-from-fn2, data-from-fn3]`.

## Details 

The `asyncTransport` function takes two arguments
- `promiseCollection` - an array of functions, if a single fn is passed, it will be converted to an array with a single element.
- `options` - an object containing params that affect `asyncTransport`'s execution. Currently only the `strategy` param is supported (see more on this below in the usage examples).

Once all functions in the `promiseCollection` have either resolved or errored (or some combination of the two), an object is returned containing 3 props. These props are

- `hasErrors` - `true` if errors were detected, `false` otherwise
- `errors` - an array of errors organized in the order in which the related functions were passed
- `data` - an array of data objects organized in the order in which the related functions to were passed

## Usage Examples

### Basic (aww snap, you basic!)

```javascript
const asyncTransport = require('async-transport');

// mock async fns
let asyncThing1 = () => {
   let deferred = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
     setTimeout(() => {
      resolve({ foo: 'bar' });
     }, 100)
   });
   return deferred;
}
let asyncThing2 = () => {
   let deferred = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
     setTimeout(() => {
      resolve({ baz: 'boom' });
     }, 50)
   });
   return deferred;
}

// Working with promises via async/await
let foo = async () => {
    let theData = await asyncTransport([ asyncThing1, asyncThing2 ]);    
    console.log(theData);
}
foo();

// Above code logs the following object to the console
{
  hasErrors: false,
  errors: [ null, null ],
  data: [ { foo: 'bar' }, { baz: 'boom' } ]
}
```

### Other usage examples coming soon! In the meantime, please see the [tests](https://github.com/technicolorenvy/async-transport/blob/master/__tests__/async-transport.test.js) for more interesting use-cases and examples.
